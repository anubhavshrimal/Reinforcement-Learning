# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains the implementation of different Reinforcement Learning Algorithms I have learned throughout the [Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893). 

Each algorithm is used to solve different [OpenAI gym environements](http://gym.openai.com/envs/).

## Algorithms

1. [Monte Carlo](./monte-carlo/)
2. [Temporal Difference Algorithms](./temporal-difference/)
   * [Sarsa(0)](./temporal-difference/CliffWalking/)
   * Q-Learning / Sarsamax
      * [CliffWalking-v0 environment](./temporal-difference/CliffWalking/)
      * [Taxi-v2 environment](./temporal-difference/Taxi-V2/)
   * [Expected Sarsa](./temporal-difference/CliffWalking/)
3. [RL in Continuous Space](./RL-in-continuous-space/)
   * [Discretization](./RL-in-continuous-space/Discretization.ipynb)
   * [Tile Coding](./RL-in-continuous-space/Tile_Coding.ipynb)

## Projects
